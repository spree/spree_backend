Please review the [Spree Contributing Guide](https://dev-docs.spreecommerce.org/contributing/index)

### Development Setup (JavaScript)

When working on the JavaScript in Spree Dashboard locally, you will need to yarn link your local development copy of `@spree/dashboard`, to the Rails app you are working in, so that your changes are picked up and represented live in the view.


From the root of `spree_backend` run:

```bash
yarn link
```

Next, from the root of the Rails app you are using to develop run:

```bash
yarn link "@spree/dashboard"
```

Once your local Spree Dashboard is linked with the Rails app you are using for development you will need two terminal tabs open, 
one at the root of your Rails app, and one at the root of `spree_backend`.

In the terminal window at the root of the `spree_backend` run:

```bash
yarn watch
```

And from the Rails app you are using to run Spree and develop in run the following:

```bash
bin/dev
```
Any changes made to the JavaScript files in `spree_backend` will be processed by yarn and picked up in the Rails app you are running for development.

### Local setup

1. Fork it!
2. Clone the repository
3. Create test application:

    ```bash
    cd spree_backend
    bundle install
    bundle exec rake test_app
    ```

### Running tests

Entire test suite (this can take some time!)

```bash
bundle exec rspec
```

Single test file:

```bash
bundle exec rspec spec/features/admin/users_spec.rb
```

[ChromeDriver](https://chromedriver.chromium.org/) is required for feature tests. On MacOS you can install it by running:

```bash
brew install chromedriver
```
